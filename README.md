### Notes
The direction in Liaodong is not very accurate due to the destruction after Battle of Sarhu and the collapse of Ming dynasty.

The direction of inner wall(in North Zhili, Shanxi, Shaanxi), especially in the boundary of provinces Hebei and Shanxi was not well constructed initially, which brings obstacles in geodata-collection.
